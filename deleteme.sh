Hi David, thanks for the clarifications. I now have a preliminary idea of the business, and since the funds have already been aproved, I'm ready to continue with the due diligence. 
I have submitted a Letter of Intent including seller financing and non-compete clause. We can discuss the terms of those clauses now or after the due diligence. 
I set a bid price of 50K after doing my numbers. 
Hope you find this offer attractive so we can move on into the next stage.
Regards

     
Hello David, thanks for your quick response. Some of the follow up questions I have:
- According to your stripe connection in Flippa, I can see the following monthly revenue breakdown

DATE      SALES
Nov 2023  $1,000
Dec 2023  $6,700
Jan 2024  $6,750
Feb 2024  $6,999
Mar 2024  $12,681
Apr 2024  $750
May 2024  $1,250
Jun 2024  $1,750
Jul 2024  $6,531
Aug 2024  $2,574
Sep 2024  $875
Oct 2024  $250

Which does not match with the revenue you provided in the spreadsheet. Why is there a discrepancy?


- As for the 10000 scan limit, as far as I understand, the model returns scores as it scans images on a given Postal Code. I guess you have a distress threshold that leads have to reach in order to make it to the final leads list, right?. As you said, if the customer enters a brand new neighborhood with very few distress properties, the 10000 scan limit would kick in before we got 100 leads. But the user already paid for them. What do you do in that situation, do you serve less leads or you lower the threshold, or you contact the client?

- Do multiple runs on the same Postal code produce the exact same output?

- When someone places an order they enter the Zip codes in the order as "Other Information". I guess you get notified from stripe and you take the postal codes and run a scan manually? Then you get the results (leads) and email them back to the client manually? Is this process of picking up Zip codes and feeding them to the Model automated? 

- Do you have google analytics in place for the landing page? How Can I see some traffic information from when you ran ad campaings?


General
- What prevents you from keeping the business as it looks like it can be highly automated?
- How much time do you spend on the business on a weekly basis? 
- Do you have any recurring contractors? You mentioned you used external contractors for the labeling process, any other?

Providers
- Who is you skip tracing data provider?
- Do you do DNC flagging?
- Who is your Image provider
- Did you develop the ML model "in-house" or someone else did?

Business Model.
- What's the competitive advantage against propstream and dealmachine?
- From the user's point of view, why not just use the above platforms where you are not attached to a Postal Code and you can apply more filters? 
- What's your price strategy and how did you come up with the per-lead price? alternatives may be either free (Check MLS database) or about the same price per lead (accounting for the fact that they're subscription based).
- If you don't do ad campaigns, do people stil engage? for those who do, do you know if they repeat?
- Why did not you do a subscription-based business model from the beginning? any obstacle?
- Who is your typical client? individual investors? experienced? newbies?

Processes
- How do you update the landing page? Is it a custom design? WordPress?
- How do you update the images used to identify distressed properties? Does the image provider give you a huge zip and you insert those images into a database, and then the model reads the relevant ones (requested Postal code) it every time you process an order?
- Do you retrain your ML model regularly?


Deal
- Who is the current owner of the assets on sale? LLC? C-Corp?
- Any trademark or license associated to the owner company?

Typically, after all of this is clear, I could submit a LOI, subject to the due diligence which is mostly a zoom call where you walk me through the code, your important processes (database update, order processings, ...) and the financial platform. I would also require recent tax filings 

Let me know if this sounds good
Looking forward to reading your answers.
Regards.
